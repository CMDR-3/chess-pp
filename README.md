# chess++
Chess++ is a simple CLI chess game written in C++.

Originally written with Linux in mind, this code should compile on Windows too.
The only external library is required on Linux:

I am aware there is some spaghetti code and move validation isn't a thing yet,
also this code is heavily undocumented.

# Build Instructions

To build on Linux, just clone the repo and run "make"
On Windows, you can just use mingw and use g++ to compile.
